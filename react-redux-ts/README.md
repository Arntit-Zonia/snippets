# react-redux-ts

- This snippet contains a basic react-redux (with typescript and hooks) structure to get you started on your projects

## Installing the required dependencies

- cd into the project directory
- Run this command in your terminal ```npm i redux react-redux @types/react-redux redux-thunk @types/redux-thunk ```

## Using the snippet
- Move the "state" folder into your project
- If you're working with an already existing codebase ensure that your index.tsx file has been hooked up to the redux store via the "Provider" component
